# R-Project
ðŸ“š Introduction to Student Score Data Project in R:
Objective:
Analyze student score data to understand patterns, factors affecting performance, and predict future scores.

Data Source:
Dataset containing student details such as gender, study time, parental education, test preparation course, and exam scores.

Purpose:
Identify trends and relationships in student performance.

Visualize the distribution of scores.

Build models to predict scores based on various features.

Key Tools Used:
R Programming for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

Libraries: dplyr, ggplot2, tidyverse, caret, readr.

Steps in the Project:
Import and explore the dataset.

Clean and preprocess the data.

Perform descriptive and inferential statistical analysis.

Visualize insights with plots and graphs.

Build simple predictive models (like linear regression).

Expected Outcomes:

Detailed report of factors influencing scores.

Interactive visualizations.

Predictive model to estimate student scores.
